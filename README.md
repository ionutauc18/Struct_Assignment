# StructAssignment

Create a struct called Number and give it the property “Amount” and have it be of data type decimal.

In the Main() method, create an object of data type Number and assign an amount to it.

Print this amount to the console.

Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.
